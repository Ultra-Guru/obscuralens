"""
Explainable rule packs for ObscuraLens (v5.1).

The :mod:`obscuralens.rules` package turns OSINT triage heuristics into
YAML data so analysts can read, audit and override the exact criteria an
investigation is scored with.  It complements
:mod:`obscuralens.correlation.risk` (weighted code signals) with packs of
human-reviewable rules::

    from obscuralens.rules import evaluate_rules, rules_summary

    evaluation = evaluate_rules('domain', payload)
    for hit in evaluation.hits:
        print(hit.rule.id, hit.rule.title, hit.explanations)
    print(evaluation.score, evaluation.band)   # 0-100, clean..critical

Packs live in ``obscuralens/rules/packs/<kind>.yaml`` (one per target
kind plus the always-evaluated ``shared`` pack); user directories can be
injected via the ``OBSCURALENS_RULES_DIR`` environment variable.  Loading
is tolerant -- a broken pack is skipped with a warning, never an
exception -- and every rule explains itself with plain-language
conditions such as ``registration.age_days <= 30``.

Like the rest of ObscuraLens, these rules describe *technical
indicators*, not people: they are triage aids for analysts, not
verdicts.
